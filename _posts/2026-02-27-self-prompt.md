I write promts for agents everyday - lots of them.

But I've never written any prompts for myself, and that doesn't feel right.

So here are a few for myself:
1. Go to bed on time.
2. Exercise daily.
3. No sugar.
4. Read serious articles and books on my own
5. Write my blog by myself.
6. Hand-craft my agent and let it build others.
